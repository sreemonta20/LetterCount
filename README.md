// Letter Count:: 
/*This problem I have encountered for a xyz company online coding challenge. Here is how i have solved this using typescript */

/** Have the function LetterCount(str) take the str parameter being passed and reurn the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters. For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces. */

/**Example: test Cases 
 * Input : "Hello apple pie"
 * Output: Hello
 * 
 * Input: "No words"
 * Output: -1
